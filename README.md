# php-m framework

php-m is a very slim framework, that offers a solid boilerplate, that can be used for many simple, but also more complex web applications.

php-m was designed to be very unopinionated, lightweight and secure. It is also designed to be deployed easily in any environmnet as it tries to rely on as little operating system specific functionality and config-specific functionality as possible.

## Installation instructions
To initiate a new project in php-m with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), follow these easy steps:
* `composer create-project nualiian/php-m`
* `mv .env.example .env` and fill out your credentials
* `bower install` to install the frontend dependencies
* `npm install` to install all the npm dependencies
* `npm run build` to build the resources
* ready to use!

--- 
php-m offers this functionality out of the box:

## Authentication
The framework has its own session based Auth class, that is ready to be used in your application. The main user model class is located in `framework/Core/Auth`.
To login a user you simply need to call `Auth::login($credentials)` in you controller. Logout on the toher hand is provided via `Auth::logout()`.
Auth class also offers a convenience method for retrieving the user from the session by calling `Auth::user()`. If there is no user loggd in `false` will be returned.
To create a new user, you can call `User::create($credentials)` and pass in an array of credentials (email and password) to persist a newly created user into the database.

## Database manipulation
php-m uses [NotORM](http://www.notorm.com/) as and active record manager for the database.

## Building resources
This boilerplate comes with a custom gulpfile that builds your resources, which are located in the `resources` folder. It uses Sass for stylesheets. php-m also comes preloaded with [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com) framework.

## What to do when developing
* `npm run watch` to build resources as you go
* serve your webpage, e.g. `php -S localhost:3000 -t .`, or set up any other server using apache, nginx, ...
