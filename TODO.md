# This is the TO-DO list for php-m

* Rewrite `gulpfile.js` (is way too slow, becasue it minifies materalize css on watch each time) + consider switching to webpack
* Implement base `Model` class with commnon functions for models (database interactions) and make default models extend it
** relationship functions to be easily accessible with that
